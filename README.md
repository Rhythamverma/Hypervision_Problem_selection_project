# Hypervision Problem Selection Project

This is a simple web application built with Python and Flask. It allows users to browse and select from **20 different problem statements**. The user's name and email are then stored in a local SQLite database.

The core logic ensures that any single problem statement can only be selected a maximum of **3 times**.
